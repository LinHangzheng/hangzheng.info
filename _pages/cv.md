RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
------
**Accurate Tooth Pose Estimation in 3D Intraoral Scans using Deep Learning** May 2021 – present

* Advisor: Liu Zuozhu, ZJU
*	Proposed an automatic and efficient model based on Dynamic Graph CNN (DGCNN) for the tooth transformation task.
*	Generate a precise rotation and ensure the accuracy of transformation.

**Deep Learning Models for Human Aggression Detection**	May 2020 - Present

* Advisor: Volodymyr Kindratenko, UIUC
* Created our own dataset which we manually cut and labeled from internet to evaluate their flexibility.
* Reproduced and compared several vision-based neural network models, including Transfer Learning model, conv-LSTM, 3D convolution model, on human aggressive behavior.
* Developed new CNN models, including optical flow based VGG and transfer learning + LSTM models.

**Human Falling Detection by Optical  Flow and CNN** January 2020 - May 2020

* Advisor: Volodymyr Kindratenko, UIUC
* Developed a Convolutional Neural Network to train a neuro-based model to detect human falling.
* Created our own video data set and analyzed different data stacking patterns on neural network training.
* Implemented an end-to-end human falling detection model by using camera video stream to provide alarm service.

**HUAWEI HiSilicon**	July 2019 - August 2019

* Involved in the Huawei Turing department and participated in the development of Da Vinci chip operators. (The Da Vinci chip is one of the most advanced neural network chips in the world)
* Accelerated the data transmission by optimizing the way to allocate the moving data and to divide data into parts with their corresponding buffer and cache.
* Successfully reduced the transmission delay from 50ms into 3ms.


**Mathematical Contest in Modeling**	January 2019 

* Advisor: Wei Liu, ZJU-UIUC Institute (Prof. Wei Liu moved to KTH)
* Selected, configured, optimally packed, deployed and operated a set of midsize (group 2) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that would supplement existing relief to medical supply chains in Puerto Rico.
* Used AHP to set the weights for selected features and did normalization for them. Applied 3D Bin-Packing API to approach the optimal solution of 3D packing problem. Applied Greedy Algorithm, Graph theory to calculate the accurate optimum location.
* Provided a stable model to solve the two NP problems with high usage of containers, quick speed to meet hospital’s needs.
* Awarded the Outstanding Winners (0.1%) and the Informs Award (No.1 world ranking 0.02%)
